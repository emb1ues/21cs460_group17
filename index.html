            Water, some esssential chemicals and a source of energy. That's all life needs, these are the "ingredients" for life. Europa, an icy moon of Jupyter, 
            of about the same size as our own moon (but waayyy more interesting than our moon) has all the necesaary ingredients. But you won't think so if you just
            take a look at it - I mean, it looks dead and diseased (with all those red scars!). But what's interesting about this moon is not visible from outside.
            It has an ocean which contains about twice as much water as earth below it's thick icy crust. Below that ocean, are rocks and possibly, geothermal
            activity. But that geothermal activity is not what's keeping the ocean from freezing, obviously it's not the sunlight which is aborbed and reflected
            by the thick icy crust. This somewhat magical, somewhat mysterious, source of energy is Jupyter itself. Specifically, it's the tidal forces of Jupyter on 
            Europa. It is this same phenomena which results in those scars. But why are the scars red? We can only guess. This phenomena makes us rethink
            the definition of the goldilocks zone. It seems like moons of massive planets, far away from the host star are also inhabitable and we should broaden our
            horizon and look for exo icy moons as potential candidates for life. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Clearly, the possibility of life makes Europa a very interesting target. Afterall, if we find life on Europa, however small and primitive may it be, 
            it will tell us one thing very clearly - if life can happen, it will happen. And our whole universe must be beaming with life.

        <p>
            The most interesting geographical feature of Europa are the Lineas (short for Lineaments), the red scars, so to speak. The exact reason for their 
            formation is unknown but people have maade some guesses. It might be partly due to tidal forces from  Jupyter and partly due to asynchronous rotation
            of Europa with Jupyter.
            We aren't yet sure what kind of salts are present there. In this project, we will investigate the Lineas, try to find out what
            salts are present  in the Lineas and see (and hope) something organic comes up. Hydrated salts have already been detected in Europa and it seems just 
            like a matter of time before we find organics.

            Goal 1: Identifying all the Lineas

            <li>
                Using Convolutional Neural Networks, we will identify all the Lineas on Europa.

            <li>
                We would furthur like to classify the Lineas. There is already a way to classify the Lineas into 4 classes based on the geographical features. 
                This would be just a K means problem with 4 centers. Shall time permit, we would also like to classify them as old and new which we can guess by
                overlaps of the Lineas.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Using data from Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer of Galileo and other spectroscopy data of ground and space based telescopes, we would want to find
                the salts present in the Lineas. 
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Check if the concentration or the availability of the salts is higher on the Lineas. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This might be analytical as an ML approach to it goals 2 would take huge memory, unless we find something clever

            The Neural Networks will be coded by both of us. Rion will look for more spectroscopy data in space based telesccopes while Nishant will for them in 
            ground based ones. For Classifying the Lineas, Rion shall work on classification based on age using DBSCAN while Nishant works on classifying based 
            on geographical features using K Means. We will need (a lot of help) from our mentor, Guneshwar Sir, especially in the second part.

            What to expect by midway:

            <li>
                Goal 1: <br> 
                We will have had a run an image recognition algorithm on Europa to identify all the Lineas. However, we expect some errors since Lineas 
                overlap over one another. We will have fixed these errors after a few weeks from midway.

                Goal 2: <br>

            Expectations from the project:
        </h1>
        <p>
            People have guessed that the red colour of the Lineaments is due to magnesium sulphate or sulphuric acid. If that is the case, the spectroscopy data
            restricted to just the Lineas should match with spectrum of the these compounds. But why does it matter? The chemical composition of the Lineas
            will give us massive hints about the chemical composition of the oceans underneath. The better understanding of the chemical composition of Europa is 
            very desirable since that will give us hints about the lifeforms (crossed-fingers) and their biological processes
