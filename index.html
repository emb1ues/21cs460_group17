            Water, some esssential chemicals and a source of energy. That's all life needs, these are the "ingredients" for life. Europa, an icy moon of Jupyter, 
            of about the same size as our own moon (but waayyy more interesting than our moon) has all the necesaary ingredients. But you won't think so if you just
            take a look at it - I mean, it looks dead and diseased (with all those red scars!). But what's interesting about this moon is not visible from outside.
            It has an ocean which contains about twice as much water as earth below it's thick icy crust. Below that ocean, are rocks and possibly, geothermal
            activity. But that geothermal activity is not what's keeping the ocean from freezing, obviously it's not the sunlight which is aborbed and reflected
            by the thick icy crust. This somewhat magical, somewhat mysterious, source of energy is Jupyter itself. Specifically, it's the tidal forces of Jupyter on 
            Europa. It is this same phenomena which results in those scars. But why are the scars red? We can only guess. This phenomena makes us rethink
            the definition of the goldilocks zone. It seems like moons of massive planets, far away from the host star are also inhabitable and we should broaden our
            horizon and look for exo icy moons as potential candidates for life.

            Clearly, the possibility of life makes Europa a very interesting target. Needless to say, that is what we wanted to work on. Afterall, if we find life on
            Europa, however small and primitive may it be, it will tell us one thing very clearly - if life can happen, it will happen. And our whole universe must be
            beaming with life. But good data, if any regarding organics in Europa is impossible to find! Hence, we are settling down for another question that comes 
            to our mind - Why are those scars red, though?

            Those bloody red scars are formed (or believed to be formed) from the tidal forces pulling apart the ice sheets. Our aim is to first identify the lineas
            on Europa (from images) by making a linea detection algorithm. We will then proceed to classify it as one of the 4 types of lineas. We will probably use 
            a Neural Network for recognizing the Lineas and classifying them using k Means with 4 centres (right?).

        </h1>
    
        <p>
            Using data from Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer of Galileo and other spectroscopy data of ground and space based telescopes, we would want to find
            the salts present in the Lineas. Ummm, not really sure how machine learning could be used for this.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Goal 1: Find out the location of all the Lineas on Europa. If time permits, we might classify them as well since that shouldn't be too hard
            </li>
            <li>
                Goal 2: We already have the data from NIMS, Galileo. We hope to collect space and ground based telescopes' spectroscopy data by midway

            Expectations from the project:
        </h1>
        <p>
            People have guessed that the red colour is due to magnesium sulphate or sulphuric acid. If that is the case, the spectroscopy data restricted to just 
            the Lineas should match with spectrum of the these compounds.
