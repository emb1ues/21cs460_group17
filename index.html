            Water, some esssential chemicals and a source of energy. That's all life needs, these are the "ingredients" for life. Europa, an icy moon of Jupyter, 
            of about the same size as our own moon (but waayyy more interesting than our moon) has all the necesaary ingredients. But you won't think so if you just
            take a look at it - I mean, it looks dead and diseased (with all those red scars!). But what's interesting about this moon is not visible from outside.
            It has an ocean which contains about twice as much water as earth below it's thick icy crust. Below that ocean, are rocks and possibly, geothermal
            activity. But that geothermal activity is not what's keeping the ocean from freezing, obviously it's not the sunlight which is aborbed and reflected
            by the thick icy crust. This somewhat magical, somewhat mysterious, source of energy is Jupyter itself. Specifically, it's the tidal forces of Jupyter on 
            Europa. It is this same phenomena which results in those scars. But why are the scars red? We can only guess. This phenomena makes us rethink
            the definition of the goldilocks zone. It seems like moons of massive planets, far away from the host star are also inhabitable and we should broaden our
            horizon and look for exo icy moons as potential candidates for life. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Clearly, the possibility of life makes Europa a very interesting target. Afterall, if we find life on Europa, however small and primitive may it be, 
            it will tell us one thing very clearly - if life can happen, it will happen. And our whole universe must be beaming with life. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The most interesting geographical feature of Europa are the Lineas (short for Lineaments), the red scars, so to speak. The exact reason for their 
            formation is unknown but people have maade some guesses. It might be partly due to tidal forces from  Jupyter and partly due to asynchronous rotation
            of Europa with Jupyter.
            We aren't yet sure what kind of salts are present there. In this project, we will investigate the Lineas, try to find out what
            salts are present  in the Lineas and see (and hope) something organic comes up. Hydrated salts have already been detected in Europa and it seems just 
            like a matter of time before we find organics.

            1. Creating the Dataset

        <img class = "list" src="images/masks.png">

        <p>
            The images were collected from Galileo's Solid State Imaging instrument which have been made public by NASA through PDS-atlas. 
            Seven 800x800 images have been marked by hand using arivis. Two such images are shown above.

            2: Data Augmention and Imbalance Handling
        </h1>            
            <p>
                Since CNNs rely on augmentation of the data to make the feature extractor invariant of orientation and position of the object in an object,
                the dataset was augmented using rotations (upto 90 degree), horizontal and vertical flips, zooming and stretching along different directions.
            </p>

            <p>
                In our case, the minority class (Lineas) are too less in numbers. Because of this, even if the model predicts almost all the pixels to be majority 
                class, the accuracy is very high. The way to tackle this problem is to undersample the majority class and/or oversample the minority class.
                Our dataset first RUSed (random deletion of majority class points) and then SMOTEd (synthetic generation of minority class datapoints).
                This improves the IoU significantly.

                Features are extracted through traditional image filters and passed to a Random Forest. 
                Dimensions are reduced for improving speed and decreasing expense. 
                Since there are many hyperparameters, like the SMOTE and RUS ratios (dataset handling), min_samples_split (RF) and n_estimators(RF),
                we believe tuning these hyperparameters might significantly improve the results, but GridSearchCV is too expensive for us.

                In this model, A CNN is trained (with a fully connected dense layer in the end) with an augmented dataset, the metric is set as jaccard. 
                The feature extractor of the CNN is used to extract features from the images and these are passed to a Random Forest to classify each pixel.
                Instead of building a CNN and training it to get a feature extractor, one can also get pretrained feature extractors 
                which are basically image segmentaion CNN frameworks trained on standard datasets.

                One of the standard image segmentaion, state-of-the-art model. In this model, a contracting CNN path (encoder) is built through convolutional and max pooling layers.
                These are skip connected to an expanding path (decoder) made through convolutional and upsampling layers. The metric that has been aimed for is the jaccard.

            1. Anomaly Detection (executed)

        <img class = "list" src="images/anomaly.PNG">

        <p>
            Since Lineas are connected structures, isolated points marked as Lineas are likely to be outliers. To exploit this fact, DBSCAN was run on the set of 
            points predicted to be on the lineas with n (min samples for a cluster) = 2 and epsilon (distance below which point will be in the same cluster) = 1 
            and the euclidean metric and dropped all the outliers. Since such points were few, nothing significant came out of this attempt. However,
            this does increase the precision (and hence the f1 score)

        <p>
            In this approach, because of the high cost of labelling the pixels, active learning is used to start the model early even when it has low accuracies.

        <p>
            Anomaly detection to update confidence in each DT in the RF. 
            Maybe active learning for CNN-RF hybrid is novel. It not not with UNET. 
            weighted augmentation: Besides these 7 masks, we have additional 4 rougher masks. And among these seven masks, 2 are more accurate than the other 5. 
            An weighted augmentation can be done to take more samples from the more accurate masks and less samples from the rougher masks.

        Concluding Remarks

        <h1>    
            The Bigger Goal
        </h1>
    
        <p>
            People have guessed that the red colour of the Lineaments is due to magnesium sulphate or sulphuric acid. If that is the case, the spectroscopy data
            restricted to just the Lineas should match with spectrum of the these compounds. But why does it matter? The chemical composition of the Lineas
            will give us massive hints about the chemical composition of the oceans underneath. The better understanding of the chemical composition of Europa is 
            very desirable since that will give us hints about the lifeforms (crossed-fingers) and their biological processes.
